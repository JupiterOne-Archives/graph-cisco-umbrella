# Development

Cisco provides a sandbox that can be used for developing against. The sandbox
environment can be set up for as many as two weeks or as short as a few hours.

## Provider account setup

- Sign up for a [Cisco developer account](https://developer.cisco.com/).
- Once signed up and logged in, navigate to the
  [Cisco Lab Catalog](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology) and select
  the Reserve button for Cisco Umbrella.
- The system will take several minutes to set up and will email login
  credentials to you once complete.
- You can now log in to the Cisco Umbrella sandbox instance and create test
  entities and relationships.

## Authentication

Using the above Cisco Umbrella sandbox account, an API key can be created with
the same scopes recommended to end users for testing and development purposes.
